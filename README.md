# Fansly Stream Recorder

This script allows you to record fansly streams live to a .mp4 file and automatically upload the VOD to the cloud using rclone, and uses discord webhooks to keep you updated on the status(stream start/file conversion/upload).

âš  This only works on public streams that don't require following/subs.

â„¹ You may be able to add your cookies to the headers to be able to record streams of followed/subbed models. (I don't actively follow many models, especially ones that go live on the platform to test) 

# Setting up


1. Install required python modules for the script:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Alongside installing [mt](https://github.com/mutschler/mt#installation-from-source) to genereate a contact-sheet of the live.
2. Install and create a rclone remote (`rclone config`) if you don't already have one and then edit `fansly-recorder.py` and add the following:

   - The rclone config `cat $HOME/.config/rclone/rclone.conf` for the host you want to push the files to
   - The remote path to `rcloneRemotePath`

Example:

```
rcloneConfig = """
[remote]
type = drive
scope = drive
token = {"access_token":"......."...}
"""
rcloneRemotePath = "remote:path/to/FanslyVods/"
```

3. Replace instances of `webhook_url` to your webhook url for your notify channel, as well as replacing the id in `mention` for the role or user id to ping. As well as other small changes that will have comments to let you know. 

# Running

The script will continue to loop and check for the model to be live and then start to record, once finished it will push the file to the remote and go back to checking for the model to be live again.


Run the script

```
python fansly-recorder.py {username}
```

Recommend to run the script in tmux to be able to close the terminal.

Create a new tmux session:

```
tmux new -s Fansly
```

Again run the script:

```
python fansly-recorder.py {username}
```

press `ctrl + b` then `d` to detach from the session.

Alternatively, you can use the `start.sh` script to create the tmux instances and run the script:

```
bash start.sh {username}
```
